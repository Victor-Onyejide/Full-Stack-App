* Test
 to see if the ids in the list are not equal 

* Error
When adding todo that has the same text it duplicates it on the frontend it does not give a new id and it does not write to the databse file
   *** OBV
   The app would have to be refreshed for it to be able to behave properly
   Is this a state issue
